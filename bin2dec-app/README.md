# Bin2Dec

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these constraints:
- Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
- Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function to use.

## User Stories
- User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
- User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered
- User can enter a variable number of binary digits
